# Diabetes-Readmission-Prediction
Predict 30-day readmission risk for diabetic patients (Kaggle dataset).
# Project Overview
This project predicts the 30-day readmission risk for diabetic patients using hospital data from Kaggle.  
The goal is to practice end-to-end machine learning — from data exploration to model building — on realistic healthcare data.
